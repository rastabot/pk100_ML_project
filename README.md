The gym chain Model Fitness is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data.

One of the most common problems gyms and other services face is customer churn. How do we know if a customer is no longer with us? We can calculate churn based on people who get rid of their accounts or don't renew their contracts. However, sometimes it's not obvious that a client has left: they may walk out on tiptoes.

In order to fight churn, Model Fitness has digitized a number of its customer profiles. Our task is to analyze them and come up with a customer retention strategy.
